<h2 align=3D"center"><strong>Twee Editors</strong></h2>
<p align=3D"center">Source code for small text editors</p>
<p align=3D"center">Feb. 29, 2004</p>
<!-- <hr> -->
<p align=3D"left">*A 'twee' editor is one that is only a few
multiples of the minimum size for a functional editor, without
compression.</p>

<p align=3D"left">I have been a programmer since 1975, when I wrote
my first Forth compiler, assembled it by hand into octal and then
_hand toggled_ it into a binary register on a Bendix BDX-900
mini-computer. 1100 18bit words, if I recall correctly.</p>

<p align=3D"left">The second version of Forth was a real
improvement. I hand assembled the opcodes into hex and hand
keyed them in thru an alter/examine/execute hex monitor on an
8-bit 6502 microprocessor. Took about 1250 bytes.</p>

<p align=3D"left">The third time I had a line editor and assembler,
both loaded from cassette tape onto the development system. There,
I edited source from a keyboard and then assembled and loaded
the resulting binary using the computer. How much better can it
get?</p>

<p align=3D"left">What did I learn from the above? Forth, machine
language and that I really, really needed a text editor. Have been
writing, and re-writing them ever since.</p>

<p align=3D"left">What I learned in my early days of contract
programming was that 60% of the project was the design phase, 20%
was the entering code phase, 10% debugging and the rest
maintenance. Proper design and debugging only required a line
editor to get the requisite changes into the computer. So
communicating with computers doesn't require much more than a
command line that recognizes backspace and enter keys.</p>

<p align=3D"left">But then things got complicated. Modems became
popular. Email and online accounts became geek requirements. Now
I was communicating with peepul. And they require more
flexibility in their communications. That was when the screen
editor came into wide use. We programmers now had smiley faces
for emotive connotations. The rest of the world sneered at us and
moved on to 'word processors' with colors and fonts.</p>

<p align=3D"left">How many different ways are there to communicate
between humans thru a computer? Just the factorial of the number
of connections between humans using computers. Humans can and do
change their mode of communication with each person they attempt
to communicate with. The wide spread use of word processors now
makes somewhat more sense to me. </p>

<p align=3D"left">So much for word processors. I was being paid to
communicate with computers. Back to ASCII text editors.</p>

<p align=3D"left">As the pace for project development increased,
the amount of time decreased. Management was paying to see
results. So a more flexible editor was needed to demonstrate the
progress on a project. Heh. What they got was screen editors that
could fling data past them faster than they could read it. But
volume was impressive and they were satisfied.</p>

<p align=3D"left">What does a GUI have to do with real-time OSs and
hardware driver development? Not much. But GUIs were the new
trippy toy and you could really dazzle people with the new
editors. But I still keep ASCII screen editors around for when I
really have to get the job done. Where do you think this software
came from?</p>

<p align=3D"left">My first ASCII screen editor was Wordstar. Hated
it, but the control key sequence came eventually. The next screen
editor demanded I learn new controls, which I refused. Wrote my
own text editor. With Wordstar control codes. Moved from CPM to
DOS. Same thing. Learn new control sequence. Same response. Find
source to already written text editor. Rewrite to Wordstar
control sequence. (I will also mention there were a whole slew of
Forth text editors I wrote, but that is for a historical
perspecitve on Forth). Been doing one or the other ever since.
Never professionally polished, just good enough to suit my needs.
And it always teaches me something new and useful.</p>

<p align=3D"left">One final note. An absolute necessity for me, in
a text editor, is an 'undo' feature. With that, I have both error
recovery and a real time micro CVS while doing program
development. If a text editor doesn't have undo, it is just a
toy.</p>

<p align=3D"center"><strong>A Brief History of Interactive Text
Editors</strong></p>

<p align=3D"left">We'll skip the old punch cards and go straight to
teletype.</p>

<p align=3D"left">In the beginning was the line editor. Open a
file, list lines in a file, delete line(s) to kill buffer, insert
immediate line/kill buffer to a specified point, write to file
and exit. Undo in the form of a kill buffer. How much simpler can
it get?</p>

<p align=3D"left">Then came the VDU (Video Display Unit, remember
the ADM-3A?), a CRT serial terminal which enabled 'the screen
editor'. Open file, display a full screen of text, move cursor,
insert characters, mark blocks of text, copy/delete/save marked
blocks, insert file, create file, save file, close file and exit.
Not really that much more complex.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Then came the PC with mouse interface. Augment
the keyboard text selection with mouse movement and button
clicks. But this 'simple' change wasn't. It required a secondary
task running in the background to unite asynchronous mouse motion
and button clicks.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Then some genius recognized that the screen
updating could be handled by the same background task that ran
the mouse and, voila, the WIMP (Windowed Interface, Mouse
Pointer) GUI (Graphical User Interface) was born. Display
characters or paint pretty fonts (or pretty pictures for that
matter), track point-and-click to select text or change/update
the display.</p>

<p align=3D"left">After several years of shaking out, the
multi-tasking versions settled into a common simplified form: </p>

<ul>
    <li><p align=3D"left">open a Window GC (Graphical Context)</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align=3D"left">set fonts and colors</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align=3D"left">open/create the text file for editing</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align=3D"left">editor main loop gets mouse and keyboard
        events, translates to insert/mark/delete/save/load/quit
        actions. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p align=3D"left">Each editor instance is treated as a
        single task. </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align=3D"left">If an OS main() executive is monitoring and
providing the mouse/keyboard events, then it can intercept and
pre-empt any other task in order to switch-to/kill any given
task. Not quite the simplified logic of a line editor, now is it?</p>

<p align=3D"left">The following table of 'Twee' editors tracks this
development cycle and provides the data for some observational
conclusions. The group ordering is roughly that of the sequence
that each genre was developed. Linux/UNIX is both near first and
last because the UNIX command line started with line editors
before DOS existed, but is late to the party for mature simple
GUI text editors. </p>

<p align=3D"left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align=3D"left">* Note: for the purposes of this discussion, the
word 'functional' means: posseses a reasonable set of features to
provide usable operation. The word 'operational' means: a less
than acceptable set of features and is barely usable.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Go ahead, say "Lisp based emacs is
simple." Make. My. Day.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Which is why Forth is included. It predates UNIX,
and is famed, nay, notorious, for it's simple editors. </p>

<p align=3D"left">See the c4th.com screen text editor for a simple
1k source, 544 bytes of code screen text editor. Of course it is
limited to editing only a few k of text, but it shows how small
an operational screen editor can be. Oh, sure, be strict and
include the interactive, open-ended, programmable, incremental
compiler/interpreter with file I/O and it is still only 9752
bytes in length.</p>

<p align=3D"left">The u4.com forth text editor shares the same
source with the 4word text editor. The editor code sizes are 1984
and 4241 bytes. u4 is a 16-bit version of Forth, while 4word is a
32-bit version that gives you access to the entire 386+ physical
memory. What a difference an architecture makes! The Forth kernel
sizes are 9556 and 17395 bytes, respectively. (What can I say?
32-bit code is larger). The u4/4word text editors are basic
screen editors with forward search. Functional for Forth
programming purposes. Operational for a generic text editor.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Maybe I finally got it right. ue is my take
on the optimal mixture of code size and functions. String
search, undo and tab character handling in a 6.4k screen editor.
I have looked for 20 years for a basic ASCII screen text editor.
Finally quit looking and converted Anthony Howe's 1991 Obfuscated C
Code winning editor, ant, to a basic screen editor. Good for
rescue disks and roll-your-own projects.</p>

Everything you ever _needed_ in a functional text editor.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Albrecht Kleine's e3 screen editors are about the
finest examples of maximum utility/artistry in a small package.
Simple, e3 aint. The code optimization tricks in e3.asm can keep
me up all night (they have). But it is the smallest (12550
bytes), most complete standalone screen text editor, with undo,
you can find for linux. Extreme functional artistry.</p>

<p align=3D"left">For the binary or OS challenged, Albrecht also
provides e3c.c. File size, there, is 15208 bytes. Multiple
interface styles including Wordstar. Extremely functional.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Mye is an updated version of Yijun Ding's ee.c.
It utilizes termcap I/O and also compiles under Win32. Yijun's
original code simplicity is reflected in a final binary size of=20
22168 bytes. Has nearly identical capacities to Edx, including
undo/redo. Basic WordStar control key clone. Functional.
</p>

<hr>
<strong>DOS command line:</strong><p></p>

<p align=3D"left">DOS provided the ubiquitous environment that
produced some of the simplest and/or smallest screen text editors
ever. </p>

<p align=3D"left">See Tom Kihlken's ted.asm for the results of a
collision between a line editor and cursor/function keys. And in
only 2982 bytes of assembler. Now that is elegant programming in
a functional editor. </p>

<p align=3D"left">Albrecht Kleine has e2dos.com. Artistry in a
WordStar clone at 3294 bytes. Quite functional. (Albrecht says
e2dos.asm is TASM source, but I was able to compile it with MASM,
your choice).</p>

<p align=3D"left">The ke.com editor is my hacked version of ted
that uses the WordStar control sequence, with the addition of a
search function and status line. Size blossoms to 4570 bytes.
Functional.</p>

<p align=3D"left">But Brian Kelly's tm.com editor is the icing and
the cake. A partial list of features include 4088 bytes in size,
command line loading, incremental forward/reverse search and
undo. Byte for byte the most efficient end-user application I
have ever seen. And his code optimizations are a full course in
assembler language programming. Beyond functional. A dedicated
work of art.</p>

<hr>
<strong>Win32 command line:</strong><p></p>

<p align=3D"left">The Win32 command line suffers from a lack of
text editors from the Windows world. (Cygwin may be in the
Windows world, but it is not of it.) Same source for e3 and mye,
but in a Win32 environment. See above for functional
descriptions/comments. e3 still rocks.</p>

<hr>
<strong>Win32 GUI:</strong><p></p>

<p align=3D"left">The Win32 GUI world suffers from bloat.
"What's the problem? It takes up a smaller percentage on the
new, bigger hard disks." A quote from an anonymous MicroSerf
when I asked why new apps were always larger.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Presented are three WIMP GUI editors written in
assembler to buck the bloated trend. All include the standard CUA
(Common User Architecture) cut/copy/paste with either keyboard or
mouse.</p>

<p align=3D"left">All three editors are derived from the MASM32
assembler kit from Hutch and Iczelion. These guys are walking
lessons in Win32 assembler, as well as superb programmers. Worth
studying in detail.</p>

<p align=3D"left">MASM32 is the definitive package for Win32
assembler programming, including MASM 6.1x, supporting binaries,
include files and libs, with tutorials and excellent working
examples. (Don't talk to me about the bloated Cygwin and NASM
doesn't include all the extras.)</p>

<p align=3D"left">Qikpad is an example asm wrapper derived from the
MASM32 kit around the Richedit text control, limited to edit file
size of 32k, max. But it does include undo. It shows how low you
can go and still be functional.</p>

<p align=3D"left">uRe (u Rich edit) is an improved version of
Qikpad that opens files up to 2Meg in size. Search and command
line file loading were also added for a binary size of 8704
bytes. Functional.</p>

<p align=3D"left">uSk is a full blown notepad lookalike, with
toolbars and everything. The pretty eye candy and added functions
bring the size up to 16896 bytes. Contrast that with Win Notepad,
similar functionality, but 50960 bytes in size. Very functional.</p>

<p align=3D"left">SKNT (SideKlik for NT) is my 10 year old work
horse for Windows. I purchased the source for it back in 1991 and
have hacked it beyond recognizition. Sorry, but I cannot make the
source available. I bought the source, not the copyright.
Included in the table for reference only.</p>

<p align=3D"left">SKNT is a functional clone of all the features
that so endeared me to Borland's 1984/85 Sidekick TSR editor. The
best all around application ever written for a computer.
Borland's SideKick had a popup text editor with a 48k max file
size, calculator, phone book/dialer, calendar and ASCII char/hex
conversion table. All in a 39k com file. Actually made a $5000
Compaq paperweight usable. You might also now understand the
tribute I pay with some of my text editor names.</p>

<p align=3D"left">But SKNT is a much better editor than Sidekick.
with toolbar, WIMP GUI, multi-windows, file size limited by
available memory and undo/redo. Has a builtin run command,
support for grep in specified directories and external calls to
calc, calendar and Win3x phone dialer. Written in C, all in
101888 bytes. And this isn't a wrapper around a richedit text
control. Not much in the windows world that comes close. This
does provide a baseline for a nominal size of a complete Win32
GUI C source text editor.</p>

<hr>
<strong>Linux GUI:</strong><p></p>

<p align=3D"left">Lets get the worst over first. Xedit. Mutant
sport of emacs. Wrapper around the Xaw textWidget. </p>

<p align=3D"left">First impression: "Of course it's hard to
use. It was hard to write!". Which was pretty much the case
until Xfree86 4.xx came along and added undo and position_changed
callback. Now you can know where you are when you make mistakes
and undo them. Of course you have to enable undo with the
app-defaults file.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Which is the savior of xedit. By editing Xedit.ad
and then copying it to </p>

<p align=3D"left">'/etc/X11/app-defaults/Xedit' (or the equivalent
on your system)</p>

<p align=3D"left">xedit becomes something rare: a functional,
stable X text editor. In only 9980 bytes!</p>

<p align=3D"left">No, no, not the bloated <a href=3D"https://web.archive.or=
g/web/20040723024036/ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.2.0/source/">Xfree=
86
4.xx xedit</a> (don' need no steenking spell-checker). Use the <a href=3D"h=
ttps://web.archive.org/web/20040723024036/ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/unsupported/p=
rograms/xedit/">source
from Xfree86 3.3.2</a> and add the following line to the xedit
apps-default file</p>

<p align=3D"left">'xedit.textSource*enableUndo: True'</p>

<p align=3D"left">You may also want to change the key bindings.
After spending 6-10 hours of editing xedit's app-defaults file,
Xedit, you might end up with something useful. And along the way
learn that you can also _add_ functions by compositing multiple
key functions onto one key. See the supplied uSk.ad and U.ad for
working examples of Wordstar style remapping and multiple
function compositing.</p>

<p align=3D"left">A minimal operational text editor app can be
constructed. For file loading, it inserts a named file into an
empty file. Text editing is the same that is available from
xedit. But the only way to save the text is to select the whole
file with a mouse and paste it to a command line of 'cat &gt;
file.txt'. Terminate with a '^C' to the command line. Sorta
defeats the purpose of a text editor. But it only takes 4170
bytes. Left as an exercise for the reader to contruct from the
u.c source (hint: remove everything that is not required to
create the Xaw window and associate it with the textwidget).</p>

<p align=3D"left">u is a minimal functional wrapper for the Xaw
textwidget. Loads files from the command line, creates a new
empty textwidget, inserts files at the cursor, saves file, does
forward/reverse search and replace and undo. In 7032 bytes. You
can do everything from the mouse/keyboard, so why do you need
menus or a toolbar?</p>

<p align=3D"left">For your geek mother, there is uSk. A notepad
clone, Xaw style. Super-set of 'u', but with a status line, menus
and toolbar. Provides help by invoking usk on<br>
'/etc/X11/app-defaults/uSk', <br>
has an about dialog, opens a second usk, calls rxvt and allows
the source_changed flag to be reset. Also has goto line#, a
decent X file picker, dialog and messagbox support. As functional
as any X text editor I have seen. The resulting size is about
16600 bytes.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Funny, thats almost an identical size to the same
functionality available from uSk.exe under Win32 GUI. uSk on X,
is written in C, uSk.exe is written in assembler. What's wrong
with this picture? Answer: uSk.exe has to generate the Search
dialog box for the Richedt20.dll. libXaw.so.7 has a
Search/Replace dialog as a builtin. Interactive dialog boxes are
very expensive in setup and creation of the individual
controls/widgets, regardless if it is Win32 or X.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Edx is an on going proof of concept. It takes and convert=
s=20
the ASCII terminal text engine from mye and runs it under a bare X window.=
=20
Edx provides all of the functions operational under terminal mode. Edx is
now feature complete with full mouse and selection integration. Edx is
functionally equivalent to SKNT, minus the menus/toolbar and multi-window
capability. Size is a very reasonable 32856 bytes for a complete text edito=
r=20
under X. WS clone. Very functional.
</p>

<p align=3D"left">Provided for comparison, is ge, a near functional
GTK notepad clone which uses the GTK textwidget library. Much less=20
functional than notepad, but in 30488 bytes. Not even close to Xaw=20
in features.</p>

<hr>
<strong>Conclusions and Projections:</strong><p></p>

<p align=3D"left">The absolute minimum size for an operational
ASCII editor is about 1k, including File I/O, on a 16-bit
processor. For a functional screen editor, the empirical minimum
size seems to be about 3k. For a professional grade editor, 4k.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Go to a 32-bit command line and the minimum size
blossoms to at least 10k. The larger byte count seems to be in
the operand size and the OS interface overhead. Could also be in
just plain extra functionality. That is, if you are writing in
assembler.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Code size goes up by a minimum factor of 1.5 or
larger when you switch to C code.</p>

<p align=3D"left">With GUI you get text (widgets and controls).
Makes for small binary size, but depends upon resident
dynamically linked libraries. The problem with that is, the
functions provided may not match your needs, and the API to
integrate your needs is only available at the library source
level, which may not be available. I.E. the API dont exist.</p>

<p align=3D"left">The Win32 Richedt20.dll is 431k, while the entire
libXaw.so.7 is only 335k, of which the textwidget is approx. 30% or
102k. To put it into perspective, a text editor (15k), which is
just a wrapper around a text widget or a text control (100k+), come
to a total size of 120k+. Or write your own editor, in C, custom
fit to your needs for about 100k...or less.</p>

<p align=3D"left">Edx (aka EditX) is a basic text editor
construction kit for bare X, which comes in at around 30k. See
above. It is a feature complete standalone pure X text editor. No
menus or toolbar, just control and function keys plus mouse.
Undo/redo in only 1120 bytes. Dynamic buffer allocation in around
1100 bytes. Usable cursor mouse integration in about 2k, vertical=20
srollbar and 3D effects in 1.3k and X selection in 2k. The logical=20
breakdown of components seperate quite nicely into the X interface=20
in edx.c, while the editor engine is complete in eeng.c. Code kept=20
as simple as possible, but no simpler.</p>

<p align=3D"left">For assembler, you have a minimum size of the
edit engine being about 12.5k. Add the minimum overhead to
XtCreateManagedWidget (non-functional u size of 4k times the .66
scale factor for assembler) of 2.7k plus 1.7k for menus (.66
times 2.5k) for a grand total of about 16k to port e3.asm to X.
This would be editor + window code + menus+undo.</p>

<p align=3D"left">If you get/have a complete text editor+source for
any of the above platforms, please let me know. I will include a
link from the Twee Editors table.</p>
