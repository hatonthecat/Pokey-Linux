Installation Steps

For building Yocto images, I will be using a Lenovo Thinkpad E420 from 2012. 
It has an i3 2350M (x86-64-v2) with 6GB RAM. It originally came with 4GB DDR3.
A 120GB SSD was installed a while back ("upgraded" from a 500GB HDD with 8KB cache).

Yocto 5.0 says around 90GB storage is needed and 8GB of RAM.
I estimate I will not need that much, so I will wing it.

I will be installing Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS. 
Ubuntu uses around 25GB. I should have around 85GB left over.

I used an 8GB SD card with USB-SD adapter. The ISO file is 6GB

I used Raspberry Pi Imager to erase and flash the drive 
(it works remarkably well, despite Windows 10 errors saying otherwise)
This guide confirms 8GB fits: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-ubuntu-24-04

After installing Ubuntu, I have 99GB left over. Better than expected.

I used this tutorial to install the required files for Yocto:

I followed the YT video until it got to the part about installing/upgrading Python3.

So in the first section (up to around 0:30, I installed git, then tar. The commands for "sudo apt get install gawk wget..." weren't working so I jumped (back or forward) to the Part 2 tutorial, which seems to have filled in some of the blanks.

$ sudo apt update

The first one worked, but it listed optional updates. I did not select them, although I might. (Edit: I got a prompt window asking to install 180MB+ of updates, so I selected yes)

$ sudo apt install git git-lfs tar python3 python3-pip gcc 

This installed the items that appeared to be in the 0:30 mark. Actually, I will return to the video tutorial:

The 0:32 mark gets a little confusiung because it's not clear if the command worked on the first line and then the sudo apt install without line breaks /  seems to be the correct formatting.

So I will resume copying the tutorial and include the ones from the webpage, possibly out of order. 



It's for an A5 board, the Jupiter Nano.
