Installation Steps

For building Yocto images, I will be using a Lenovo Thinkpad E420 from 2012. 
It has an i3 2350M (x86_64v2) with 6GB RAM. It originally came with 4GB DDR3.
A 120GB SSD was installed a while back ("upgraded" from a 500GB HDD with 8KB cache).

Yocto 5.0 says around 90GB storage is needed and 8GB of RAM.
I estimate I will not need that much, so I will wing it.

I will be installing Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS. 
Ubuntu uses around 25GB. I should have around 85GB left over.

I used an 8GB USB stick. The ISO file is 6GB

I used Raspberry Pi Imager to erase and flash the drive 
(it works remarkably well, despite Windows 10 errors saying otherwise)
This guide confirms 8GB fits: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-ubuntu-24-04
