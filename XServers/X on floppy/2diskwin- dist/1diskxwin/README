This is the new 1 disk vesion of 2 disk xwin

yet again totally untested, unsupported, demo code, use at your own risk!

it only contains the following:
busybox, tinylogin,linux-2.2.20,X11,chimera,fspanel,mungwm,xpmroot,vncviewer,rxvt. sorry but you have to sort any problems yourself, dont expect a reply to any anything, but bugs will be fixed if they are reported.

to install you need a floppy that supports 1.7Mb disks
a 486 cpu and 8Mb memory
 
insert a dick (floppy not hard) into the correct slot and rub the clit script
till finished then ejaculate the floppy.

simple

Hope U have fun!
