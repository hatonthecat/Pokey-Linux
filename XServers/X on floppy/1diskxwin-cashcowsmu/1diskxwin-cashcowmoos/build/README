ssh works, out of the box
remote X11 session works! (xhost +), out of the box
html 4.0 full compliance (https, dom(70%), css(parse plugin removed for size), javascript(removed for size), table markup is broken due to removal of javascript back parsing)

It only contains the following:

It is now distributed as a 1.44Mb minix floppy image you can mount the image by 
"mount -o loop 1dskx.img -t minix mountdir/ ; gzip -d mountdir/Image.gz". 
"mount -o loop mountdir/Image -t minix mountdir1/". 
you may want to add different drivers or a new kernel (but that is your problem).

Sorry but you have to sort any problems yourself, dont expect a reply to anything, 
but bugs will be fixed if they are reported.

Known bugs

some systems dont recognise serial mice well due to int 10 overlay
