keymaps for i8n keyboards

You may also want to look at X fonts as follows.

on your favoured system with X

dump your favourite fonts:
fstobdf -server unix/:-1 -fn -*-helvetica-*-*-*-*-*-120-*-*-p-*-*-* > Example.bdf

examine the characters defined using xfd e.g.:
xfd -fn -*-helvetica-*-*-*-*-*-120-*-*-p-*-*-*

any you dont require find the encoding number e.g. char 148 is not needed
grep for "ENCODING 148" then delete between the STARTCHAR and ENDCHAR

then fix the bdf headers CHARS, etc...

then recode

bdftopcf -o h.pcf Example.bdf ; gzip h.pcf ; cp ./h.pcf.gz X11/fonts/misc/h.pcf.gz

its only really for those hardcore size optimizers and tweakers though.
