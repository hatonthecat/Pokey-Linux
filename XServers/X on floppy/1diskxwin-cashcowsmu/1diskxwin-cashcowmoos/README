1st April 2006 release 1.2.27

Now includes linux-lite kernel!

this is a source dist to create a bootable floppy linux X window system.
it has lots of stuff removed from the standard xfree dist to ease
network bandwidth. it also lacks many packages from the full 2diskxwin source tree.
On the up side it is only 8.4Mb so should download fast, and can now be self compiled 
on a system with 64Mb of core(if you know how).

it has been tested to compile OK(with minor hacks) on the following:
redhat 5.2
suse 6.2, 6.4
mandrake 7.2, 8.0, 8.1
debian >2.2

it assumes you have all required build tools if you don't know how to setup your 
build tools dont try asking me!

you prolly need:
gcc
bison
flex
autoconfig

you should check the README and config files in each sub dir and edit if 
necisesary check the following:
xc/config/cf/site.def
busybox/Config.h
uClibc/Config
build/Config

you may also want to edit the COMPILER, LD, and AR variables in the make script.
make sure you have a floppy formated to 1.4Mb in /dev/fd0.
 then:
you can type './make remake' 
or you can type './make clean'

take your pick!

then type one of the following:

cd build ; ./floppy_boot.sh
cd build ; ./humungous.sh
cd build ; ./usb_boot.sh
cd build ; ./cd_boot.sh

you should end up with a bootable floppy!,mung image, bootable usb device, 
or bootable cd image.

but then again you may not?.

obviously there are some deliberate mistakes to keep you on your toes
and help you learn new things. also there are some mistakes due to the 
removal of the mungconfig system and some of the packages.

do not attempt to waste mungkies time by contacting him, unless you
know what you'r talking about and have something useful to say.
