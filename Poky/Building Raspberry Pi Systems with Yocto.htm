          <h2>Building Raspberry Pi Systems with Yocto</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Jun 2020</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This post is about building 32-bit Linux systems for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> boards using software from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto Project</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in 64-bit systems for the RPi4 see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Raspberry-Pi-4-64bit-Systems-with-Yocto.html">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Yocto is a set of tools for building a custom embedded Linux 
distribution. The systems are usually targeted for a particular 
application like a commercial product.</p>

<p>If you are looking to build a general purpose development system with
 access to pre-built packages, I suggest you stick with a more 
user-friendly distribution like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a>.</p>

<p>Yocto uses <strong>meta-layers</strong> to define the configuration. 
Within each meta-layer are recipes, classes and configuration files that
 support the primary build tool, a python app called <strong>bitbake</strong>.</p>

<p>I have a custom meta-layer for the RPi boards called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi">meta-rpi</a>.</p>

<p>The systems built from this layer use the same GPU firmware, linux 
kernel and include the same dtb overlays as the official Raspbian 
systems. This means that no hardware functionality is lost with these 
Yocto built systems as compared to the “official” Raspbian distro. It is
 only the userland software that differs and that is completely 
configurable by you.</p>

<p>There are a some example images in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi">meta-rpi</a> that support the programming languages and tools that I commonly use in my own projects.</p>

<p>When using this repository for customer projects, I first fork and 
move it to another repository, usually with a different name. I 
recommend you do the same if you require stability. I use the meta-rpi 
layer for experiments.</p>

<p>My systems use <strong>sysvinit</strong>, but Yocto supports <strong>systemd</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://www.qt.io/">Qt5</a> developer then you will appreciate that the RPi comes with working OpenGL drivers for the RPi GPU. This means <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtopengl-index.html">Qt OpenGL</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html">QML</a> applications will work when using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/embedded-linux.html">eglfs</a> platform plugin.</p>

<p>I am using the official Yocto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-raspberrypi">meta-raspberrypi</a> layer, but have updated recipes for the Linux kernel and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware">gpu firmware</a>
 to keep them more current. I also have occasional ‘fixes’ to other 
components, sometimes for bugs, but often just because I don’t like the <strong>meta-raspberrypi</strong> defaults.</p>

<p>I have access to all of the RPi boards and have at one time or another tested these builds with all of them including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module/">RPi CM and CM3</a> modules.</p>

<p>Most of the time I test only with RPi3 and RPi0-W boards. For RPi4 boards I use 64-bit builds (linked above).</p>

<h3 id="downloads">Downloads</h3>

<p>If you want a quick look at the resulting systems, you can download some pre-built images <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://jumpnowtek.com/downloads/rpi/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Instructions for installing onto an SD card are in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://jumpnowtek.com/downloads/rpi/README.txt">README</a>.</p>

<p>The login user is <strong>root</strong> with password <strong>jumpnowtek</strong>.</p>

<p>You will be prompted to change the password on first login.</p>

<p>All systems are setup to use a serial console. For the RPi’s that 
have it, a dhcp client will run on the ethernet interface and there is 
an ssh server running.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a firewall rule that will lock out your IP for 2 minutes after 5 failed logins.</p>

<h3 id="system-info">System Info</h3>

<p>The Yocto version is <strong>3.1</strong>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[dunfell]</code> branch.</p>

<p>The default <strong>5.4</strong> kernel comes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">github.com/raspberrypi/linux</a> repository. There is also a <strong>4.19</strong> recipe.</p>

<p>These are <strong>sysvinit</strong> systems using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Eudev">eudev</a>.</p>

<p>The Qt version is <strong>5.14</strong> There is no <strong>X11</strong> and no desktop installed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://www.qt.io/">Qt</a> GUI applications can be run fullscreen using one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/embedded-linux.html">Qt embedded linux plugins</a> like <strong>eglfs</strong> or <strong>linuxfb</strong>, both are provided. The default is <strong>eglfs</strong>.</p>

<p>Python <strong>3.8.2</strong> with a number of modules is included.</p>

<p>gcc/g++ <strong>9.3.0</strong> and associated build tools are installed.</p>

<p>wireguard from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-linux-compat/about/">wireguard-linux-compat</a> is installed.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://elinux.org/Omxplayer">omxplayer</a> is installed for playing video and audio from the command line, hardware accelerated.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/README.md">Raspicam</a> the command line tool for using the Raspberry Pi camera module is installed.</p>

<p>There is an example image that I use for a couple of Raspberry Pi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Raspberry-Pi-Pandora-music-player.html">music systems</a>. They use either an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://www.iqaudio.co.uk/home/9-pi-digiamp-0712411999650.html">IQaudIO Pi-DigiAMP+</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.hifiberry.com/ampplus/">HiFiBerry Amp+</a> add-on board and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://6xq.net/pianobar/">pianobar</a>, a console-based client for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> internet radio.</p>

<p>The Adafruit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.adafruit.com/products/2441">PiTFT 3.5”</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.adafruit.com/products/1601">PiTFT 2.8”</a> resistive touchscreens work. Support for some other TFT displays is included, but I haven’t tested them.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/AndrewFromMelbourne/raspi2fb">Raspi2fb</a>
 is included for mirroring the GPU framebuffer to the small TFT 
displays. This allows for running Qt GUI applications on the TFTs.</p>

<h3 id="ubuntu-setup">Ubuntu Setup</h3>

<p>I use either <strong>18.04</strong> or <strong>20.04</strong> Ubuntu 64-bit servers for builds.</p>

<p>You will need at least the following packages installed</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>build-essential
chrpath
diffstat
gawk
libncurses5-dev
python3-distutils
texinfo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For all versions of Ubuntu, you should change the default Ubuntu shell from <strong>dash</strong> to <strong>bash</strong> by running this command from a shell</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Choose <strong>No</strong> to dash when prompted.</p>

<h3 id="clone-the-dependency-repositories">Clone the dependency repositories</h3>

<p>For all upstream repositories, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[dunfell]</code> branch.</p>

<p>The directory layout I am describing here is my preference. All of 
the paths to the meta-layers are configurable. If you choose something 
different, adjust the following instructions accordingly.</p>

<p>First the main Yocto project <strong>poky</strong> layer</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git poky-dunfell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the dependency layers under that</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ cd poky-dunfell
~/poky-dunfell$ git clone -b dunfell git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
~/poky-dunfell$ git clone -b dunfell https://github.com/meta-qt5/meta-qt5
~/poky-dunfell$ git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
~/poky-dunfell$ git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These repositories shouldn’t need modifications other then periodic 
updates and can be reused for different projects or different boards.</p>

<p>My own common meta-layer changing some upstream package defaults and adding a few custom recipes.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/poky-dunfell$ git clone -b dunfell https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-jumpnow
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="clone-the-meta-rpi-repository">Clone the meta-rpi repository</h3>

<p>Create a separate sub-directory for the <strong>meta-rpi</strong> repository before cloning. This is where you will be doing your customization.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ mkdir ~/rpi
~$ cd ~/rpi
~/rpi$ git clone -b dunfell git://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meta-rpi/README.md</code>
 file has the last commits from the dependency repositories that I 
tested. You can always checkout those commits explicitly if you run into
 problems.</p>

<h3 id="initialize-the-build-directory">Initialize the build directory</h3>

<p>Again much of the following are only my conventions.</p>

<p>Choose a build directory. I tend to do this on a per board and/or per
 project basis so I can quickly switch between projects. For this 
example I’ll put the build directory under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/rpi/</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meta-rpi</code> layer.</p>

<p>You could manually create the directory structure like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir -p ~/rpi/build/conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or you could use the Yocto environment script <strong>oe-init-build-env</strong> like this passing in the path to the build directory</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ source poky-dunfell/oe-init-build-env ~/rpi/build
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Yocto environment script will create the build directory if it does not already exist.</p>

<h3 id="customize-the-configuration-files">Customize the configuration files</h3>

<p>There are some sample configuration files in the <strong>meta-rpi/conf</strong> directory.</p>

<p>Copy them to the <strong>build/conf</strong> directory (removing the ‘-sample’)</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi$ cp meta-rpi/conf/local.conf.sample build/conf/local.conf
~/rpi$ cp meta-rpi/conf/bblayers.conf.sample build/conf/bblayers.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you used the <strong>oe-init-build-env</strong> script to create the build directory, it generated some generic configuration files in the <strong>build/conf</strong> directory. If you want to look at them, save them with a different name before overwriting.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, but you may want to customize the configuration files before your first build.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not use the ‘<strong>~</strong>’ character when defining directory paths in the Yocto configuration files.</p>

<h3 id="edit-bblayersconf">Edit bblayers.conf</h3>

<p>In <strong>bblayers.conf</strong> file replace <strong>${HOME}</strong>
 with the appropriate path to the meta-layer repositories on your system
 if you modified any of the paths in the previous instructions.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not include <strong>meta-yocto-bsp</strong> in your <strong>bblayers.conf</strong>. The Yocto BSP requirements for the Raspberry Pi are in <strong>meta-raspberrypi</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, if your directory structure does not look exactly like this, you will need to modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bblayers.conf</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/poky-dunfell/
    meta-jumpnow/
    meta-openembedded/
    meta-qt5/
    meta-raspberrypi
    ...

~/rpi/
    meta-rpi/
    build/
        conf/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="edit-localconf">Edit local.conf</h3>

<p>The variables you may want to customize are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MACHINE</li>
  <li>TMPDIR</li>
  <li>DL_DIR</li>
  <li>SSTATE_DIR</li>
</ul>

<p>The defaults for all of these work fine with the exception of <strong>MACHINE</strong>.</p>

<h5 id="machine">MACHINE</h5>

<p>The <strong>MACHINE</strong> variable is used to determine the target architecture and various compiler tuning flags.</p>

<p>See the conf files under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meta-raspberrypi/conf/machine</code> for details.</p>

<p>The choices for <strong>MACHINE</strong> are</p>

<ul>
  <li>raspberrypi (BCM2835)</li>
  <li>raspberrypi0 (BCM2835)</li>
  <li>raspberrypi0-wifi (BCM2835)</li>
  <li>raspberrypi2 (BCM2836 or BCM2837 v1.2+)</li>
  <li>raspberrypi3 (BCM2837)</li>
  <li>raspberrypi4 (BCM2838)</li>
  <li>raspberrypi-cm (BCM2835)</li>
  <li>raspberrypi-cm3 (BCM2837)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only build for one type of <strong>MACHINE</strong> at a time.</p>

<p>There are really just two <em>tuning</em> families using the default Yocto configuration files</p>

<ul>
  <li>arm1176jzfshf - for the the BCM2835 boards</li>
  <li>cortexa7thf-neon-vfpv4 - for the BCM2836 and BCM2837 boards</li>
</ul>

<p>Boards in the same family can generally run the same software.</p>

<p>One exception is <strong>u-boot</strong>, which is NOT the default for the systems being built here.</p>

<p>One of the reasons you would want to use <strong>u-boot</strong> with the RPis is to work with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://mender.io/">Mender</a> upgrade system.</p>

<h5 id="tmpdir">TMPDIR</h5>

<p>This is where temporary build files and the final build binaries will end up. Expect to use at least <strong>50GB</strong>.</p>

<p>The default location is under the <strong>build</strong> directory, in this example <strong>~/rpi/build/tmp</strong>.</p>

<p>If you specify an alternate location as I do in the example conf file
 make sure the directory is writable by the user running the build.</p>

<h5 id="dl_dir">DL_DIR</h5>

<p>This is where the downloaded source files will be stored. You can 
share this among configurations and builds so I always create a general 
location for this outside the project directory. Make sure the build 
user has write permission to the directory you decide on.</p>

<p>The default location is in the <strong>build</strong> directory, <strong>~/rpi/build/sources</strong>.</p>

<h5 id="sstate_dir">SSTATE_DIR</h5>

<p>This is another Yocto build directory that can get pretty big, greater then <strong>8GB</strong>. I often put this somewhere else other then my home directory as well.</p>

<p>The default location is in the <strong>build</strong> directory, <strong>~/rpi/build/sstate-cache</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="root-password">ROOT PASSWORD</h4>

<p>There is only one login user by default, <strong>root</strong>.</p>

<p>The default password is set to <strong>jumpnowtek</strong> by these two lines in the <strong>local.conf</strong> file</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>INHERIT += "extrausers"
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "usermod -P jumpnowtek root; "
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These two lines force a password change on first login</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>INHERIT += "chageusers"
CHAGE_USERS_PARAMS = "chage -d0 root; "
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can comment them out if you do not want that behavior.</p>

<p>If you want no password at all (development only hopefully), comment those four lines and uncomment this line</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"

#INHERIT += "extrausers"
#EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "usermod -P jumpnowtek root; "

#INHERIT += "chageusers"
#CHAGE_USERS_PARAMS = "chage -d0 root; "
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can always add or change the password once logged in.</p>

<h3 id="run-the-build">Run the build</h3>

<p>You need to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4779756/what-is-the-difference-between-source-script-sh-and-script-sh">source</a> the Yocto environment into your shell before you can use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.1/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual.html">bitbake</a>. The <strong>oe-init-build-env</strong> will not overwrite your customized conf files.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ source poky-dunfell/oe-init-build-env ~/rpi/build

### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake '

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-toolchain-sdk
    adt-installer
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
~/rpi/build$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t use any of those <em>Common targets</em>, but instead always write my own custom image recipes.</p>

<p>The <strong>meta-rpi</strong> layer has some examples under <strong>meta-rpi/images/</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="build">Build</h3>

<p>To build the <strong>console-image</strong> run the following command</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/build$ bitbake console-image
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may occasionally run into build errors related to packages that 
either failed to download or sometimes out of order builds. The easy 
solution is to clean the failed package and rerun the build again.</p>

<p>For instance if the build for <strong>zip</strong> failed for some reason, I would run this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/build$ bitbake -c cleansstate zip
~/rpi/build$ bitbake zip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then continue with the full build.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/build$ bitbake console-image

<p>To build the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qt5-image</code> it would be</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/build$ bitbake qt5-image
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <strong>cleansstate</strong> command (with two s’s) works for image recipes as well.</p>

<p>The image files won’t get deleted from the <strong>TMPDIR</strong> until the next time you build.</p>

<h3 id="copying-the-binaries-to-an-sd-card-or-emmc">Copying the binaries to an SD card (or eMMC)</h3>

<p>After the build completes, the bootloader, kernel and rootfs image files can be found in **<tmpdir>/deploy/images/$MACHINE** with **MACHINE** coming from your **local.conf**.</tmpdir></p>

<p>The <strong>meta-rpi/scripts</strong> directory has some helper scripts to format and copy the files to a microSD card.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Working-with-the-raspberry-pi-compute.html">this post</a> for an additional first step required for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module/">RPi Compute</a> eMMC.</p>

<h4 id="mk2partssh">mk2parts.sh</h4>

<p>This script will partition an SD card with the minimal 2 partitions required for the RPI.</p>

<p>Insert the microSD into your workstation and note where it shows up.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk">lsblk</a> is convenient for finding the microSD card.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda       8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk

`-sdb2    8:18   1   7.3G  0 part
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I will use <strong>sdb</strong> for the card on this machine.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if some partitions from the SD card are mounted. The <strong>mk2parts.sh</strong> script will unmount them.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This script will format any disk on your workstation so make sure you choose the SD card.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ cd ~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts
~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ sudo ./mk2parts.sh sdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You only have to format the SD card once.</p>

<h4 id="temporary-mount-point">Temporary mount point</h4>

<p>You will need to create a mount point on your workstation for the copy scripts to use.</p>

<p>This is the default</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ sudo mkdir /media/card
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You only have to create this directory once.</p>

<p>If you don’t want that location, you will have to edit the following scripts to use the mount point you choose.</p>

<h4 id="copy_bootsh">copy_boot.sh</h4>

<p>This script copies the GPU firmware, the Linux kernel, dtbs and 
overlays, config.txt and cmdline.txt to the boot partition of the SD 
card.</p>

<p>This <strong>copy_boot.sh</strong> script needs to know the <strong>TMPDIR</strong> to find the binaries. It looks for an environment variable called <strong>OETMP</strong>.</p>

<p>For instance, if I had this in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build/conf/local.conf</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>TMPDIR = "/oe4/rpi/tmp-dunfell"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I would export this environment variable before running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy_boot.sh</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ export OETMP=/oe4/rpi/tmp-dunfell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you didn’t override the default <strong>TMPDIR</strong> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local.conf</code>, then set it to the default <strong>TMPDIR</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ export OETMP=~/rpi/build/tmp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy_boot.sh</code> script also needs a <strong>MACHINE</strong> environment variable specifying the type of RPi board.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ export MACHINE=raspberrypi3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ export MACHINE=raspberrypi0-wifi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then run the <strong>copy_boot.sh</strong> script passing the location of SD card</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ ./copy_boot.sh sdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This script should run very fast.</p>

<p>If you want to customize the <strong>config.txt</strong> or <strong>cmdline.txt</strong> files for the system, you can place either of those files in the <strong>meta-rpi/scripts</strong> directory and the <strong>copy_boot.sh</strong> script will copy them as well.</p>

<p>Take a look at the script if this is unclear.</p>

<h4 id="copy_rootfssh">copy_rootfs.sh</h4>

<p>This script copies the root file system to the second partition of the SD card.</p>

<p>The <strong>copy_rootfs.sh</strong> script needs the same <strong>OETMP</strong> and <strong>MACHINE</strong> environment variables.</p>

<p>The script accepts an optional command line argument for the image type, for example <strong>console</strong> or <strong>qt5</strong>. The default is <strong>console</strong> if no argument is provided.</p>

<p>The script also accepts a <strong>hostname</strong> argument if you want the host name to be something other then the default <strong>MACHINE</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how you would run <strong>copy_rootfs.sh</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ ./copy_rootfs.sh sdb console
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ ./copy_rootfs.sh sdb qt5 rpi3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <strong>copy_rootfs.sh</strong> script will take longer to run and depends a lot on the quality of your SD card. With a good <strong>Class 10</strong> card it should take less then 30 seconds.</p>

<p>The copy scripts will <strong>NOT</strong> unmount partitions 
automatically. If an SD card partition is already mounted, the script 
will complain and abort. This is for safety, mine mostly, since I run 
these scripts many times a day on different machines and the SD cards 
show up in different places.</p>

<p>Here’s a realistic example session where I want to copy already built images to a second SD card that I just inserted.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ sudo umount /dev/sdb1
~$ sudo umount /dev/sdb2
~$ export OETMP=/oe4/rpi/tmp-dunfell
~$ export MACHINE=raspberrypi2
~$ cd rpi/meta-rpi/scripts
~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ ./copy_boot.sh sdb
~/rpi/meta-rpi/scripts$ ./copy_rootfs.sh sdb console rpi3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once past the development stage I usually wrap all of the above in another script for convenience.</p>

<p>Both <strong>copy_boot.sh</strong> and <strong>copy_rootfs.sh</strong> are simple scripts, easily customized.</p>

<h4 id="some-custom-package-examples">Some custom package examples</h4>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/scottellis/spiloop">spiloop</a> is a <strong>spidev</strong> test application.</p>

<p>The <strong>bitbake recipe</strong> that builds and packages <strong>spiloop</strong> is here</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>meta-rpi/recipes-misc/spiloop/spiloop_git.bb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Use it to test the <strong>spidev</strong> driver before and after placing a jumper between pins <strong>19</strong> and <strong>21</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/scottellis/tspress">tspress</a> is a Qt5 GUI application installed with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qt5-image</code>. I use it for testing touchscreens.</p>

<p>The recipe is here and can be used a guide for your own applications.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>meta-rpi/recipes-qt/tspress/tspress_git.bb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check the <strong>README</strong> in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://github.com/scottellis/tspress">tspress</a> repository for usage.</p>

<h4 id="adding-additional-packages">Adding additional packages</h4>

<p>To display the list of available recipes from the <strong>meta-layers</strong> included in <strong>bblayers.conf</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~$ source poky-dunfell/oe-init-build-env ~/rpi/build

~/rpi/build$ bitbake -s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have the recipe name, you need to find what packages the recipe produces. Use the <strong>oe-pkgdata-util</strong> utility for this.</p>

<p>For instance, to see the packages produced by the <strong>openssh</strong> recipe</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/build$ oe-pkgdata-util list-pkgs -p openssh
openssh-keygen
openssh-scp
openssh-ssh
openssh-sshd
openssh-sftp
openssh-misc
openssh-sftp-server
openssh-dbg
openssh-dev
openssh-doc
openssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are the individual packages you could add to your image recipe.</p>

<p>You can also use <strong>oe-pkgdata-util</strong> to check the individual files a package will install.</p>

<p>For instance, to see the files for the <strong>openssh-sshd</strong> package</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/rpi/build$ oe-pkgdata-util list-pkg-files openssh-sshd
openssh-sshd:
        /etc/default/volatiles/99_sshd
        /etc/init.d/sshd
        /etc/ssh/moduli
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config_readonly
        /usr/libexec/openssh/sshd_check_keys
        /usr/sbin/sshd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a package to be installed in your image it has to get into the <strong>IMAGE_INSTALL</strong> variable some way or another. See the example image recipes for some common conventions.</p>

<h4 id="playing-videos">Playing videos</h4>

<p>The RPi project has a hardware-accelerated, command-line video player called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/http://elinux.org/Omxplayer">omxplayer</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a reasonably sized example from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402082642/https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> project to test</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@rpi3:~# wget https://download.blender.org/demo/movies/Cycles_Demoreel_2015.mov
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can play it like this (<strong>-o hdmi</strong> for hdmi audio)</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@rpi3:~# omxplayer -o hdmi Cycles_Demoreel_2015.mov
Video codec omx-h264 width 1920 height 1080 profile 77 fps 25.000000

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you get errors like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>COMXAudio::Decode timeout
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Increase memory allocated to the GPU in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.txt</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gpu_mem=128
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The RPi GPU can support more then one display, (the DSI display is 
the default), though apps have to be built specifically to support the 
second display. Omxplayer is an app with this ability.</p>

<p>So for example, with the RPi DSI touchscreen and an HDMI display 
attached at the same time, you could run a video on the HDMI display 
from the touchscreen this way</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@rpi3:~# omxplayer --display=5 -o hdmi Cycles_Demoreel_2015.mov
Video codec omx-h264 width 1920 height 1080 profile 77 fps 25.000000

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I was not able to run a <strong>eglfs</strong> Qt app on the RPi DSI display while simultaneously playing a movie with omxplayer on the HDMI display. Perhaps a <strong>linuxfb</strong> Qt app that doesn’t use the GPU could run simultaneously. Some more testing is needed.</p>
