<h2 align="CENTER">!!!! When all else fails, READ THE SCREEN !!!!</h2>

<p>This single floppy based linux X-window package attempts to provide the
basic applications and file functions required for a communications node
on the Internet. With suitable network interface card based access (T1, DSL
modem or cable modem) to the Internet,<br><br>
Xwoaf provides:<br>
jwm Win95 clone window manager,<br>
retawq (fast!) text mode web browser,<br>
OXElmo email client,<br>
edx text editor,<br>
bcalc simple four function GUI/command line calculator<br>
xcalendar date/day/time pop-up calendar.<br><br>
File functions are provided by:<br>
rxvt X-terminal program,<br>
busybox, the built in monolithic binary containing linux command line apps and<br>
txplor: a dual-pane, tree-based filemanager.
</p>
<p>NOTE: To edit any local URL linked file in this help file, Right-click
on the URL, select 'SendTo:' and then select 'Editor'.</p>
<p>The three X-apps txplor, retawq and OXElmo all started life as curses
based text-mode terminal apps. I hacked together an equivalent X-curses
API which only uses libX11 and libc based upon code I wrote for edx.<br><br>

<p>You may need to relink the mouse in /dev. Default mouse is /dev/psaux.<br>
Other available options are com1 on ttyS0 or com2 on ttyS1. e.g.:<br>
 'cd /dev;rm -f mouse;ln -s ttyS0 mouse;cd -'
 or<br>
 'cd /dev;rm -f mouse;ln -s ttyS1 mouse;cd -'<br>
 USB anything is not supported.<br><br>

the commented and verbose shell script which the busybox udhcpc code uses to
execute the DHCP functions.
</p>
<p>To enable static IP addressing set the variable 'DHCP' in

'no' to disable dhcp. Then you must configure sysinit using your static IP
address, netmask, broadcast IP address, gw IP address and DNS server IP
addresses.<br><br>
